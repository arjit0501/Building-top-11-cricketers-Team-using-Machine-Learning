## Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict Dream11 scores of cricket players based on historical performance metrics. By utilizing advanced data preprocessing techniques and training a Random Forest Regressor model, we were able to achieve highly accurate predictions.

## Highlights

- Developed a machine learning model for predicting Dream11 scores of cricket players.
- Utilized data preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the dataset for training.
- Trained a Random Forest Regressor model to make accurate predictions.
- Evaluated the model's performance using Mean Squared Error and R-squared metrics.
- Achieved an impressive accuracy of 99.55%.
- Demonstrated skills in Machine Learning, Data Preprocessing, Regression, and Python programming.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered historical performance metrics of cricket players.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the data for training by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
3. **Model Development**: Developed a Random Forest Regressor model using Python and the Scikit-Learn library.
4. **Model Training**: Trained the model on the preprocessed dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessed the model's performance using Mean Squared Error and R-squared metrics.
6. **Achieved Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy of 99.55%, showcasing the effectiveness of the model.
